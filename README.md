### INTRODUCTION #
---------------------

Hello, my name is Henry Hoffman! I am currently a student at the Penn State University majoring in Human-Centered Design and Development.
As such, many of the repositories uploaded will be from my Information Sciences and Technology classes.
However, many of them personal projects and outlets for my interest in computer programming. A guide to the repositories is listed below.

### PERSONAL PROJECTS #
---------------------

DatingMod - Modification to the video game Minecraft that spawn Male and Female Entities/Mobs, which can then be initiated in a date.

MemeMod -  Modification to the video game Minecraft that add various Internet memes to the game! 



The Odin Project

google-homepage -  My first web development project from The Odin Project. Uses HTML and CSS to mimic the look of the Google homepage.

rock-paper-scissors -  Second project from The Odin Project. Uses JavaScript to prompt the user to play "Rock, Paper, Scissors" with the computer. 


DaceyBot - Python Discord bot that returns pictures of my girlfriend's dog Dacey 



### IST CLASSES #
---------------------

IST140 - Introduction to Application Programming

I will eventually sort each project into their own respective repository, but for now, they will remain in the ist140-projects repository.
Many of these are simple assignments and may not require their own repository.


IST242 - Intermediate & Object-Oriented Application Development

As a way of tracking all of the projects, their quality, and mistakes I might have made, I have included the grade and comments recieved on each project.
Explanations for each project are placed in each repository README file. 
"Assignments" are typically easier and less demanding than "Exercises" and the final group project integrates many of the lessons learned throughout the course.
